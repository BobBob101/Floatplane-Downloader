**Floatplane Downloader** Automagically downloads the latest videos from [Floatplane](https://floatplane.com) and optionally formats them to be viewed in [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/).

Both downloading videos as they release and archiving the entire backlog is supported!<br>
This requires a **[Floatplane](http://floatplane.com)** subscription.<br>
